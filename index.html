<h2>Space Bubbles</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Traverse the strange world of MS Paint and Clipart as a brave spaceman to collect all of the valuable bubbles.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should have a relaxed experience solving the easy puzzles of using the objects in the world to move up the platforms and collect bubbles.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle Game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can use the right and left arrow keys to move along the x axis. The up arrow allows the player to jump and the down arrow allows the player to fastfall. By walking against a block or spring, the player may  push the object in that direction. Passing through the bubbles pops them and gives the player points. Landing on the spring causes the player to bounce higher than a jump. The spacebar resets the position of the blocks and spring. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating the ability to make a simple game and for the player to perform actions to solve a simple puzzle. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The fastfalling and reset button are both features added from the tutorial. The blocks and spring are objects that did not appear in the tutorial  that make the game somewhat more complex. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game follows a brave astronaut from USA, Earth. He is the first individual to step foot on an exoplanet, the newly discovered planet MSP-1. MSP-1 has a large quantity of a valuable resource that Earth desperately needs, bubbles. As such, the US government poured billions into sending a team to MSP-1 to collect those bubbles, but a ship malfunction left the game's protagonist as the only survivor.      
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The player controls the protagonist as he valiantly attempts to complete his mission and collect the valuable bubbles to bring back to Earth. He encounters obstacles such as "I can't jump that high" that the player must help him overcome to complete the mission. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is Jan Allbeck and the students in CS-325. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
~30 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The block on the ground will allow the player to jump to the lowest platform. The block on the platform can be used either to jump directly to the middle platform or stacked on the block on the ground to gain access to the middle platform. The spring will launch the player high enough to reach the top platform unless the player fastfalls on it.
